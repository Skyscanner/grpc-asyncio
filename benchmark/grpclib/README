For running the grpclib benchmark you will need to install the grpclib, this can be done by running the 
following command:

$ pip install grpclib

Proto files have been autogenerated by using the protoc compiler, if you would need to create them again you can
use the following command:

$ python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --python_out=. --python_grpc_out=. `pwd`/../../proto/echo.proto --proto_path `pwd`/../../proto
